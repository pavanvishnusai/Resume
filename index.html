    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>I'm Pavan Vishnu Sai Bestha, an enthusiastic master's student of Computer Science at the University of Florida. My areas of specialization are Data science and machine learning. I thrive when taking on new challenges with enthusiasm! My journey has been punctuated by notable projects, such as creating ML classifiers for facial recognition and advanced image classification techniques, which demonstrate my capacity for using technology to find innovative solutions. My internships in web development and biometric research allowed me to hone my programming language skills such as C, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Committed to merging technical proficiency with innovative problem-solving, my goal is to advance technology. As well as this, I want to work in an organization where I can learn new things every day and refine my skills. Furthermore, my goal is to contribute something useful back into society through my talents; additionally, I enjoy drawing Charcoal Art and Micro Art while being a YouTube creator.</p>

    <h2>Projects:</h2>
    <p><b>Choosing an optimal machine learning classifier for facial recognition:</b><br> Research intern under the guidance of Prof. Rohit Kumar Gupta
    <ul>
        <li>We researched all the classifiers and chose six to compare and submit the best based on accuracy and time consumed. To train and test data, we employed the ORL dataset, CV2, and a variety of additional libraries, followed by six classifications.</li>
        <li>The best classifier is the LDA classifier, which has 97% accuracy and a time of 0.34 seconds.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><b>Image Classification using supervised learning:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>In this study, supervised machine learning was applied. We used three sports personalities as a dataset for this project. Each photo has been assigned a name based on the data we've collected. As a result, after 50 epochs of testing, the model's accuracy was 96%.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage was that I had to wait around 40 minutes for 50 epochs to finish (looking at the fact that I had a very small number of photos for training).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>Grodel - Grocery Selling Website:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Grodel is an HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap-based website. We attempted to establish an E-commerce website specialized in selling groceries and items through this project.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>EventVoid:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a user-friendly prototype to streamline event discovery for University of Florida students using web analytics.</li>
            <li>Utilized research-based strategies to enhance event recommendations and engagement through wireframe diagrams and brainstorming.Technologies Used: Python, Django, HCI Research Methodologies.</li>
